//! This module contains the `PlayerConnection` trait that abstracts network connections.
//!
//! The trait is object-safe to allow using `dyn PlayerConnection` for both real network
//! connections (`JavaConnection`) and test connections (`FlintConnection`).

/// An object-safe trait for player connections.
///
/// This abstracts the connection layer so that:
/// - `JavaConnection` can handle real network traffic
/// - Test connections (like `FlintConnection`) can record events for assertions
///
/// # Object Safety
///
/// This trait uses type erasure for packet sending - packets must be pre-encoded
/// into `EncodedPacket` before being sent. The `Player` struct provides a generic
/// `send_packet<P: ClientPacket>()` helper that handles encoding.

    /// Returns compression info for packet encoding.
    ///
    /// Returns `None` if compression is disabled (e.g., for test connections).
    fn compression(&self) -> Option<CompressionInfo>;

    /// Sends a pre-encoded packet.
    ///
    /// This is the object-safe method that accepts already-encoded packets.
    /// Use `Player::send_packet()` for the generic version that handles encoding.
